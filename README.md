# Systen Tools Deployment

## Overview

This repository is for deploying general purpose system software that is used on HPC targets, in this case gadi@NCI utilising the [build-cd](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/build-cd) infrastructure.

## Supported tools

* `ncdu` : [NCurses Disk Usage](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu) is a disk usage analyzer with a text-mode user interface. It is designed to find space hogs on a remote server where you donâ€™t have an entire graphical setup available, but it is a useful tool even on regular desktop systems. Ncdu aims to be fast, simple, easy to use, and should be able to run on any POSIX-like system.

* `gh` : [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) is GitHub on the command line. It brings pull requests, issues, and other GitHub concepts to the terminal next to where you are already working with git and your code.

## How to use

**Requirements**: you must be a member of [`vk83`](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/project/vk83).

The software is accessible through the environment module system on `gadi`, e.g.
```
module use /g/data/vk83/modules
module load system-tools/gh
```
will load the most recent version of `gh`.

To discover what tools and versions are available:
```
module avail system-tools
```
or a specific tool
```
module avail system-tools/ncdu
```
It also works without the `system-tools` namespace:
```
module avail ncdu
```

## Support

This repository and the software deployed from it are supported by ACCESS-NRI.
