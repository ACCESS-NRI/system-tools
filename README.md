# Model Tools Deployment

## Overview


This repository is for deploying general purpose system software that is used on HPC targets, in this case gadi@NCI utilising the [build-cd](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/build-cd) infrastructure.

## Tools supported

* `ncdu` : [NCurses Disk Usage](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu) is a disk usage analyzer with a text-mode user interface. It is designed to find space hogs on a remote server where you donâ€™t have an entire graphical setup available, but it is a useful tool even on regular desktop systems. Ncdu aims to be fast, simple, easy to use, and should be able to run on any POSIX-like system.
